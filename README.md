Using node, LIRI provides responses to multiple command line prompts using the API's provided by Bands in Town, OMDB, and Spotify.

Calling the following commands will provide responses accordingly:

* concert-this, followed by an Artist, will show all upcoming concert data; if they are not touring, it will let you know.

* movie-this, followed by a Movie title, will show pertinent information about the movie, including the reviews, rating, plot, and actors; if no movie is given you will learn all about "Mr. Nobody".  Watch it.

* spotify-this-song, followed by a Song title, will show you all of the artists who have recorded that title and give you a preview link to hear to the music; if no song is given you will learn all about "The Sign", recorded by Swedish juggernaut Ace of Base.

* do-what-it-says will show you one of the above as pulled from a random file.  The suspense will drive you mad!
